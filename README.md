# InnerBrain

**InnerBrain is a lightweight, open source link vault that lets you save and categorize all your favorite resources—websites, YouTube videos, Instagram/Facebook reels, articles, podcasts, and more—in one place.**

## Think of it as your digital brain extension:

- **🗂️ Centralized Storage**  
  Store URLs from any platform, tag them, and add quick notes for context.

- **🔍 Instant Search**  
  Find exactly what you need in seconds—filter by tag, source, date added, or keywords.

- **📈 Future-Ready**  
  Built with embeddings in mind: upcoming releases will let you query your data naturally (e.g., “Show me all tutorials on React Hooks”).

- **⚡️ Lightweight & Extensible**  
  Minimal dependencies, easy to self-host, and simple to extend with your own plugins or scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satyamlal/InnerBrain.git
